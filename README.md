No anyone alone , <br />
if they're already alone . <br />

Before to observe , <br />
put yourself , <br />
one time in this way . <br />

This mindset is interesting , <br />
because the human race , <br />
points in one direction . <br />

To be the first to stay alone , <br />
before to be observed . <br />
